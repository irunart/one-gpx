# One GPX: A Working Group for Trail Running GPX Standardization

**One GPX** is a community-driven working group dedicated to establishing a clear, consistent, and practical standard for GPX files used in the context of trail running.

Our goal is to address common issues like inaccurate elevation data, inconsistent timestamps, and other problems that trail runners and race organizers often face.

## Getting Started

- **[Read the RFC](rfc.md)**: The core specification document for the One GPX standard (work in progress).
- **[Browse the Articles](articles/)**: A collection of articles and case studies about real-world GPX issues.
- **[Explore the Tools](tools/)**: Open-source utilities to diagnose, fix, and improve GPX files.
