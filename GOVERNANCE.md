# Governance Model

This project is an informal working group. The goal is to create a community-driven standard for GPX files in the context of trail running.

## Decision Making

All decisions are made through rough consensus on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/irunart/one-gpx/issues).

There are no formal roles or committees. Anyone is welcome to contribute.
